This project implements a real-time, privacy-preserving, and scalable attendance management system using face recognition across multiple camera feeds. The system integrates MTCNN for face detection, FaceNet for feature embedding, DeepSORT for continuous identity tracking, and PCA for secure embedding compression. Adaptive cosine similarity thresholding enhances recognition reliability under different lighting and movement conditions. DBSCAN clustering enables automatic registration of new faces without manual intervention. Real-time attendance is logged into a CSV file with timestamps and camera location metadata. Designed to work efficiently even with lightweight hardware setups (e.g., two webcams on a laptop), this system demonstrates high accuracy, low false positives, and robust multi-camera identity consistency, making it ideal for smart campus, corporate, and surveillance applications.
